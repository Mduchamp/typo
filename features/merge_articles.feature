Feature: Merge articles
  As a blog administrator
  In order to consolidate repetative content into larger articles
  I want to be able to merge two articles into one article

Background:
  Given the blog is set up
  And there are two articles in it
  And I am logged into the admin panel

Scenario: Merging works when both articles exist

Scenario: Merging does not work when the first article does not exist

Scenario: Merging does not work when the second article does not exist

Scenario: The new article has comments from both merged articles 

Scenario: The new article has the text of the both articles

Scenario: The new article has title of the first article

Scenario: The new article has the author of the first article
